					<h2>1st Thing: Git != GitHub</h2>

					<div style="float:left; width:45%">
						<img src="imgs/git-logo.png" width="48%" height="48%">
						<p><span style="color:#f05033;">Git</span> is a revision control system, a program to manage your source code history. It is strictly a command-line tool.</p>
					</div>

					<div style="float:right; width:45%">
						<img src="imgs/github-logo.png" width="40%" height="40%">
						<p><span style="color:#79dbf2;">GitHub</span> is a website where you can upload a copy of your Git repository. It allows people to collaborate via Git along with some other features.</p>

					<h2>What is Version Control?</h2><br/>

					<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Wikipedia</a>: "the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information."</p>

					<p>Basically, it's a way for us to compare, restore, and merge changes to our stuff.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Why Version Control?</h2>

					<p>To avoid this:</p>

					<h2>Where do we see version control?</h2>

					<p>If you've collaborated via Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides, you have used version control!</p>

					<h2>Basic Git Overview</h2>

					<p>The purpose of Git is to manage a project, or a set of files, as it changes over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a <span style="color:#f05033;">repository</span>.</p>

					<p>A Git repository contains, among other things, the following:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Snapshots of your files (text, images, whatever)</li>
							<li>References to these snapshots, called heads</li>
						</ul>

					<p>The Git repository is a hidden sub-folder in your project folder, called .git. You probably won't have to touch this ever.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Basic Git Overview: Branches</h2>

					<p>Git works on branches, which represent independent lines of development, as each snapshot is linked to a 'parent' one it built upon. By default, everyone's repositories are on a "master" branch.</p>

					<img src="imgs/git-branches.png" width="60%" height="60%">

					<p>We won't go over this in class, but <a href="http://hades.github.io/2010/01/git-your-friend-not-foe-vol-2-branches/">this tutorial</a> (where the above img came from) and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/">this tutorial</a> are really great.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Why GitHub?</h2>

                    <p>GitHub is an easy way to collaborate with others on shared Git repositories. GitHub will host it for us, and we can then sync our local copies with changes made and pushed to the shared one.</p>

                    <p>It's also the number one website for "social coding" and collaboration now...</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>SO: does everyone have a GitHub account?</li>
                            <ul><li>If not, please go ahead and <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">make one</a>.</li>
                                <li>If yes, please <a href="https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Fjoin%3Fsource%3Dheader-home">sign in</a>!</li></ul>

                <section>
                    <h2>What's a README?</h2>
                    <p>A README file broadly contains information about other files in a directory. It is usually in a plain text format, like markdown (.md) or text (.txt). It typically contains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TITLE/SUMMARY: What does your project do? How is it used?</li>
                        <li>AUTHORS: Credit the people working on the project :)</li>
                        <li>GETTING STARTED: installation & dependency instructions</li>
                        <li>LICENSE: copyright and licensing info</li>
                        <li>CONTRIBUTING: guide for people who might want to contribute to the project</li>
                        <li>THANKS: acknowledge those who made it possible!</li>

                    <h2>Editing the README</h2>
                    <p>So add at least a sentence or two in your README file -- if you're not familiar with Markdown, it's basically a way to format plain text. Click the preview tab to see how your changes look before we commit to them:</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Committing changes in-browser</h2>
                    <p>Remember how we looked at how git does version control? Since GitHub relies on git for a lot, we can see that you still need to commit changes even though we aren't in the terminal. Let's look at how we commit our changes in GitHub:</p>

                    <h2>Collaborating via GitHub</h2>
                    <p>I'll note here that there are many ways to collaborate on GitHub, from contributing code to discussing things in issues!</p>
                    <p>There are two main ways to collaborate on code: asking for permission to the repository from the owner (or, if you're doing group work, having one repo for that!) or forking a repository to which you do not have permissions</p>
                    <p>Let's start with forking and pull requests, since many of us do not have permission to many repos out there!</p>
                </section>

				<section>
					<h2>Forking & Pull Requests</h2>

					<p>A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</p>

					<p>A pull request is when you want to integrate the changes you made into the original repository you forked. You describe the changes you made and make sure your changes don't conflict with the original repo's code.</p>

                    <h2>Collaborating with others on a central repo!</h2>

                    <p>Since the joy of GitHub comes from sharing, let's discover how to collaborate with those <strong>we give permission to</strong> on here.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>You and the person to your right are now partners. People on the ends, wrap around the right.</li>
                        <li>Decide who is "A" and who is "B".</li>
                        <li>You will be syncing changes ONLY to person A's repository. Don't do anything yet</li>
                        <li>Put up the blue sticky note when you are all set!</li>
